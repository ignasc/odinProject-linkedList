## Odin Project assignment: linked lists

An assignment to build a linked list using javascript.

### Personal thoughts

This task was very unusual due to lacking the intuition that I was working with references to nodes, rather than nodes themselves. Therefore it was a challenge to work with nodes, especially implementing functions to insert/remove nodes at specified positions.
